## How to Play!
The objective of this game is to get the player(controlled by you!) from the bottom of the grid all the way to the top (the water) without colliding with the moving beatles. You can control the player by using the arrow keys(right, left, up, and down) on your keyboard. If you do happen to collide, the game will simply start over. You can play over and over again how ever many times you like. Enjoy!
